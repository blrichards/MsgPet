# MsgPet
Server benchmarking tool in Go

## Installation

2 options are available

1. install go SDK for your platform and compile code from source
2. download the precompiled executable for your platform located in the 'bin' folder

## Usage

MsgPET is very simple to use. Configuration for the tool can be set through the command line (run `MsgPET help` to see valid arguments).

### Config File

Default values for test configuration can be set by putting the key value pair in a `~/.msgpetrc` file.
This is to avoid typing out long commands each time a test is run. Command line arguments will always override config file defaults.
Valid config file pairing are as follows

* `port`:`int` -> port number of server to test
* `host`:`string` -> hostname of server to test
* `requests`:`int` -> number of requests to simulate during test
* `delay`:`string` -> delay between client requests, specified by \[number\]\[unit\] (example: `0.5ms`)
* `message-size`: `string` -> see valid message sizes below
* `single-socket`: `bool` -> if true, ignores delay value and calls requests and logs responses consecutively using a single socket (auto-defaults to false if not specified)

##### Example `.msgpetrc`

```
# .msgpetrc

port: 8080
host: localhost
requests: 100
delay: 0.5ms
message-size: rhino
single-socket: false
```

### Message Sizes

There are two methods of declaring the size of message to be sent in the test

1. an `int` representing the the size of the message in bytes
2. an animal! after all it is called MsgPET

|   Animal   |    Size    |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| `mouse`    | 8 bytes    |
| `chicken`  | 16 bytes   |
| `pig`      | 32 bytes   |
| `goat`     | 64 bytes   |
| `zebra`    | 128 bytes  |
| `rhino`    | 256 bytes  |
| `hippo`    | 512 bytes  |
| `elephant` | 1024 bytes |
| `whale`    | 2048 bytes |

## Output

Output of the tool is a summary consisting of the message used in the test, sum of response times, average response time, number of successful responses, number of failed responses, and either...

1. the speed of the server in clients/sec if all requests were successfully handled or
2. a list of error messages if any requests were unsuccessful

##### Example Output

```
$ ./MsgPET chicken
message: ySmUAPHdzzZLzDdL

Testing with single socket...

Sum of successful response times: 22.007701ms
Average successful response time: 220.077Âµs
Successful tests: 100
Failed tests: 0

Server was able to successfully handle 100 requests in 57.973972ms (1724.912000 clients/sec)
```
